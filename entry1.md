## Blog Entry

Today I am making the overview while also organizing my information in terms of AR & VR. I'm on step 5 and 6 of creating a prototype and testing/evaluating the prototype.

I learned Markdown and a bit of HTML which will be use in my blog for affects such as links, images, and visuals that emphasize my writing. The synthesis practice will also help me organize certain parts into a breakdown of what I need to add to my text.
--
I used sources of HSTAT's SEP class instruction, a markdown cheat sheet, and outside information like codecademy and youtube.

During my time writing, I used multiple skills such as collaboration, communication, problem decomposition and debugging. While figuring out my errors, I've also learned how to filter and manage what sources are reliable as well as accurate in detail.
